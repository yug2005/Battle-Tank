# Battle Tank Unreal Engine Project

## Summary 

This Unreal Engine 4 Project is an AI-integrated battle tank game developed with C++ and extensive use of hierarchy and header files. 

It involves the integration of complex tank movement and firing mechanics with user input (either through keyboard or controller). There are also enemy tank bots with integrated AI, systems to allow the AI tank to  navigate towards targets (other bots or user) and fire at them. 

There are integrated menus and HUDs for the user. There are detailed meshes and materials used in world and asset creation. See project images for previews of these features and more.
